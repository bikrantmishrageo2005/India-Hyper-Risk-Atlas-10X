# India-Hyper-Risk-Atlas-10X
India HyperRisk Atlas 10X is a state-level multi-hazard intelligence system combining ten national hazard indices—earthquake, flood, cyclone, tsunami, landslide, heatwave, drought, forest fire, air pollution and lightning. It computes a fused multi-hazard score, radar profile and ML-based vulnerability level for each state.
